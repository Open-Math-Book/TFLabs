 
\chapter{Introduction}

This book aims to introduce the reader to several computational tools that are useful for people entering careers in Mathematics and the Sciences.  We have chosen to emphasize systems that are open-source but we generally indicate other options in the introduction to each chapter.

The book is divided into 8 main chapters.

\begin{itemize}

\item This Introduction.

\item Writing with embedded mathematical content.

\item Computational Algebra.

\item The creation and inclusion of Graphics in technical documents.

\item Interactive Geometry.

\item A chapter on the use of Spreadsheets.

\item Statistics

\item Miscellaneous

\end{itemize}

In each of those chapters there will be technological as well as mathematical learning goals.  The point of this book is to collect laboratories/activities that will allow one to reach these goals through an active learning strategy: doing stuff, not being told about it!
