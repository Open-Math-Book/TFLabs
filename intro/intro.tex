 
\chapter{Introduction}

This book aims to introduce the reader to several computational tools that are useful for people entering careers in Mathematics and the Sciences.  We have chosen to emphasize systems that are open-source but we generally indicate other options in the introduction to each chapter.

The book is divided into 6 main chapters.

\begin{\itemize}
\item This Introduction.

\item A chapter on Writing with embedded mathematical content.

\item A chapter on Computational Algebra.

\item A chapter on Interactive Geometry.

\item A chapter on the use of Spreadsheets.

\item A chapter on the creation and inclusion of Graphics in technical documents.
\end{itemize}
