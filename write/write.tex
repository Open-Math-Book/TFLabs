\section{HTML}
\label{sec:html}

Have you ever seen a web URL like 
\begin{center}
\href{https://www.agnesscott.edu/lriddle/women/love.htm}{\tt https://www.agnesscott.edu/lriddle/women/love.htm}
\end{center}

\noindent and wondered what the \texttt{https} or the \texttt{htm}
meant? In both \texttt{https} and \texttt{htm}, the \texttt{ht} is
short for hypertext. The \texttt{tp} in \texttt{https} is short for
transfer protocol and the \texttt{s} is for secure. The \texttt{m}
in \texttt{htm} is for markup. All webpages, when it comes down to
it, are made of HTML (hypertext markup language) code. The HTML tells
the browser what should be displayed and, in general terms, the desired
layout. The browser takes care of the fine details depending on the
type of device, size of the screen, or personal preferences set by
the user.

Markup in HTML is like a note to the browser telling the browser how
to display the following content. The markup won't be displayed, but
it will modify how the content will be displayed. Take this screenshot
from \texttt{\href{https://www.southernct.edu/}{https://www.southernct.edu/}}
for instance.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4in]{write/SCSUscreenshot}
\par\end{center}

\noindent Simplified just a bit, the HTML code that produces the ``Back
to Campus'' announcement above looks like this:
\begin{verbatim}
<img src="/sites/default/files/back-to-campus-banner.jpg" /><p style
="font-size: 18px;">As the university prepares for the start of the
fall 2021 semester, we remain #SouthernStrong, with <a href="https://
inside.southernct.edu/reopening#services">all of the following academic
offerings and campus services</a> in place for our students in a safe,
engaging campus environment. Our goal is to get you off to a great
start, whether you're returning to campus or joining our community for
the first time!</p>
\end{verbatim}

\noindent It is just simple text! No bells, no whistles. Parts enclosed by \texttt{<}
and \texttt{>} are the markup. These parts will not be displayed themselves
but rather describe how something is to be displayed and leaves the
rest up to the browser. For example,

\begin{center}
\verb+<img src="/sites/default/files/back-to-campus-banner.jpg"/>}+
\par\end{center}

\noindent tells the browswer to insert an image ({\tt img}) and
tells the browser where to get the image ({\tt src}). This part
of the code creates

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4in]{write/back-to-campus-banner}
\par\end{center}
  
\noindent The rest of the code creates the paragraph underneath this
image. It starts with \verb+<p style="font-size: 18px;" >+ --- which
tells the browser to start a paragraph ({\tt p}) using an 18 pixel
font---and ends with \verb+</p>+, which tells the browser this
is the end of the paragraph. In the middle of the paragraph is what
makes webpages webpages---a hyperlink. The text between 
\verb+<a href="https://inside.southernct.edu/reopening\#services" >+
and \verb+</a>+ is marked up as a link, it's displayed in blue so the reader can see that
these words are where they can click. Clicking them will bring up a new webpage in
the browser.

\section{LaTeX}
\label{sec:latex}

Donald Knuth is an amazing Zen master of Computer Science and Mathematics.  He created a program called \TeX (pronounced like ``tech'') for typesetting -- especially typesetting with mathematical content.  Knuth wrote \TeX mainly as an example of a style of coding that he called ``literate programming.''  Essentially this means that the programmer creates the documentation for their work at the same time they write the actual code.  Whether it's because of it being written in the ``literate programming'' style or simply because of Knuth's amazingness, \TeX\  is renowned as one of the most bug-free systems in existance. 

\TeX\ , and a follow-on program known as \LaTeX\ , which builds on \TeX\  and extends it, have become the standard(s) for communicating mathematics.  We'll be talking only about \LaTeX\ from here onward.  \LaTeX\ is much like HTML -- it is a sort of markup language that gets processed and turned into a document suitable for visual display.  The appearance of \LaTeX source code is very different from that of HTML source code, but in many ways they are incredibly similar!  There are two marked distinctions:  HTML is meant to describe how to lay out a page so that the content is clear, and do so on many different displays -- the web-browser is empowered to alter things to aid in that clarity. On the other hand, \LaTeX is much more focussed on layout -- the first thing one does in a \LaTeX document is to specify the page size.  The author of a \LaTeX document can closely control where things will end up on that page\footnote{There is a strong argument against doing so -- the author should really concentrate on content, and let the software control the individual pixels on the page.}.
The other big difference between these systems is how well they handle mathematical content.  \LaTeX is very, very good at rendering mathematics and mathish notation from other fields like Chemistry.  HTML stinks at that, which is completely weird since the original HTML standard was created by a physicist at CERN, and physicists tend to use a lot of math\textellipsis

In a nutshell, HTML (the markup language of webpages) is used to
control how a webpage appears. \LaTeX\  plays the same role for printed
documents like books, reports, letters, or labs (like this one!).
\LaTeX\  is a markup language that excels at creating technical documents,
especially those that include mathematical formulas. You might want
to read \href{https://medium.com/swlh/the-students-guide-to-latex-markup-what-it-is-and-why-you-want-it-651e723ce0c8}{this blog}
all about why you want to learn \LaTeX.

Like HTML, \LaTeX\  uses tags to mark how text should look, to insert
graphics, to create lists, and so on. Markup in \LaTeX\  begins with
a \textbackslash{} (a backslash) as in {\tt \textbackslash pi},
which would be used to render our friend, $\pi$. Every \LaTeX\ 
document begins with the {\tt \textbackslash documentclass} tag,
which specifies what type of document is to be created (book, article,
report, etc.).  This is similar to HTML documents, which all begin with the \verb+<html>+
tag and end with the \verb+</html>+ tag. After the documentclass tag a \LaTeX\  document must include the
tags {\tt \textbackslash begin\{document\}} and {\tt \textbackslash end\{document\}}.\footnote{This is similar to HTML documents, in which the beginning of the content
is marked by {\tt <body>} and the end by {\tt </body>}.} As you can probably guess, these tags mark the beginning and end
of the content of the document. One of the simplest \LaTeX\  documents
possible is this one:

\begin{codeblock}
\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}

Hello World!

\end{document}
\end{verbatim}
\end{codeblock}

Just like HTML code, it isn't pretty! However, it tells the \LaTeX\ 
renderer what to do. This code will create an ``article'' with the
sentence ``Hello World!'' in it. 

Let's give it a try!

The next lab will lead you through the process of creating \LaTeX documents on a web-based service known as {\em Overleaf}.

\section{More LaTeX}
\label{sec:more_latex}

Before we get to working a bit more with \LaTeX , let's do some configuring that will save you a little typing going forward.
When you create a new project in Overleaf, the system automatically puts your name in as the document's author.  Unfortunately, it usually doesn't get your name right.  Click the ``home'' icon (in the upper left, next to ``Menu'').  There is a drop-down labelled ``Account'' select ``Account Settings'' from it and then fix your first and last names.

Now if you create a new blank project, the preamble of your new documents should look something like this:

\begin{codeblock}
\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{graphicx} % Required for inserting images

\title{hello}
\author{Joe Fields}
\date{August 2023}

\end{verbatim}
\end{codeblock}

Notice that commands all start with a backslash followed by the command name, followed by something in curly braces.  Well, not quite -- the thing in curly braces (a.k.a french braces) is called the argument of the command -- some commands don't have arguments, others have more than one. So the very first thing in the preamble is a {\tt documentclass} command, whose argument is the word ``article.''  Often such a command will also have optional arguements -- these are collected in square braces between the command name and the curly brace arguments.

For example:

\begin{codeblock}
\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass[12pt]{article}

\end{verbatim}
\end{codeblock}

Would make an article with a slightly larger font.  (Font styles and size can be set inside the document too.)  There are quite a few other optional arguments available.

The second line of the preamble has a couple of things worth mentioning.  The first is that there is a comment.  Any text after a \% sign is ignored, so this gives you a way to write little ``note-to-self''s.  The second is what the line is doing -- adding to the default behavior of latex.  There is a large community of \LaTeX\  users who actively develop new features.  These features are made available through {\em packages}.  

The \LaTeX\  source for this book makes use of a lot of packages: 
hyperref, geometry, fncychap, babel, makeidx, graphicx, rotating, amssymb, amsmath, amsthm, color, and ulem.  We'll explore a couple of those in the lab.

Before we head to the lab, we need to give you a little history lesson.

In the early days of computing they developed a system called ASCII (the American Standard Code for Information Interchange).  The original ASCII code used 7-bits of data to encode a character.
Seven bits allows for 128 different binary codes, which is plenty for upper- and lower-case letters, punctuation, and some control characters\footnote{This is why there's still a key on your keyboard labelled ``Ctrl''}  Those original control codes were meant to literally control the position of the typewriter head -- do things like ``move to the next line'' or ``bring the head to position 1.'' 

Anyway, \LaTeX\ (by default) uses the ASCII character encoding.  This is actually a reasonable choice since ASCII is in some sense a lowest common denomenator.  Modern environments tend to use either ISO-8859-1 (a.k.a., Latin 1) which supports most characters for European languages, or UTF-8.  UTF-8 is usually just referred to as ``Unicode.''  It is a multi-byte encoding, and supports essentally every human language.  

Why is any of this important for us?  Well, if you copy (cut and paste) text from some source on the internet, it's pretty likely that that text will be encoded in one of these more modern schemes.  \LaTeX won't quite know what to do with it, and there will be weird, tangled little confusion symbol in your output.  

Don't worry too much, somebody wrote a package for that.
