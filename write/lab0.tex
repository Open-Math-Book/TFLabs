This activity will be a little bit free-form.  You'll work in small teams to produce a Google Doc that introduces the team members.

\begin{enumerate}
\item One team member will create the doc and share it with the others.
\item Each team member will add a brief section to the document about themselves.  These sections should contain pictures.  Try to think of some entertaining ``fun facts'' about yourselves.  (It would be sad if every entry went ``Hi everyone, my name is Kal-El and I'm a Computer Science major from Waterbury.'')
\item Each team member must make a comment on, or suggest an edit to every other team member's section.
\item The relevant team members will accept or reject the edits and do something about the comments (or not\dots)
\item Share your final docs with me.
\end{enumerate}
