\section{Introduction to GeoGebra}
\label{sec:geogebra}

GeoGebra is an open source tool that lets you do geometric constructions and also work with algebraic expressions (Hence the Geo and the Gebra in the name).

GeoGebra is available as a an app for your phone, or your computer, or you can just access it via a webpage: \url{https://www.geogebra.org/}.

For doing the labs in this chapter it will be easiest to just use the web interface.  If you want to be able to save your work and/or share your work with others (trust me, this is something you'll want to do) you need to sign in.  You can use an existing sign-on, like Google or Facebook, or you can create a free GeoGebra account.  

Once you are signed in, go to the ``Home'' area and click the ``Start Calculator'' button.

At the top of the page, in the center, there is a selection box that lets you switch between 5 different versions of the GeoGebra calculator.  When you first start the calculator it will be in ``Graphing'' mode.  At the left side of the header area you'll see a ``hamburger'' that lets you access the top-level menu for the app.
