\section{Introduction to GeoGebra}
\label{sec:geogebra}

GeoGebra is an open source tool that lets you do geometric constructions and also work with algebraic expressions (Hence the Geo and the Gebra in the name).

GeoGebra is available as a an app for your phone, or your computer, or you can just access it via a webpage: \url{https://www.geogebra.org/}.

For doing the labs in this chapter it will be easiest to just use the web interface.  If you want to be able to save your work and/or share your work with others (trust me, this is something you'll want to do) you need to sign in.  You can use an existing sign-on, like Google or Facebook, or you can create a free GeoGebra account.  

Once you are signed in, go to the ``Home'' area and click the ``Start Calculator'' button.

At the top of the page, in the center, there is a selection box that lets you switch between 5 different versions of the GeoGebra calculator.  When you first start the calculator it will be in ``Graphing'' mode.  At the left side of the header area you'll see a ``hamburger'' that lets you access the top-level menu for the app.

\section{Geometric Constructions}

In the classic book ``The Elements'' by Euclid, they layed out the ground rules for doing Geometry.  People have stuck with these basic rules ever since, because figuring out how to construct things with only a limited set of tools is a great intellectual challenge.  The tools are: an unmarked straightedge (not a ruler) and a compass.  When you first open the ``Geometry'' calculator in GeoGebra, only the basic tools are shown -- you can use them to create points, lines and circles.  These basic tools essentially mirror the straightedge and compass from Ancient Greece.  With just these tools you can do quite a lot, for instance, the following diagram illustrates finding the midpoint of a segment.

Notice that the construction above also shows how to construct a line that is perpendicular to a given one, and how to construct an equilateral triangle.

When GeoGebra was first released the set of Geometry tools was very limited, but over time they expanded the toolkit -- after all, once you've figured out how to construct a perpendicular bisector, why not just let you click a single button to get one.  Still, some of the tools that are now available stretch the rules of Euclidean geometry.  For instance there is a proof that it's impossible to construct a regular heptagon (that would be a 7-sided polygon with all edge lengths and all angles equal), but there's a tool in GeoGebra that will let you construct a regular polygon with any number of sides that you desire.

In the lab, we're asking you to explore the notion of constructability, but many of the constructions can be accomplished with a single click if you find the right thing to click on.  Please restrict yourself to only using the tools that are ``allowed'' for each exercise.

\section{Parabolas}

You may recall that parabolas are one of the conic sections we played with in lab 14.  As a conic section, a parabola is the intersection of a plane with a cone -- when the plane is parallel to the side of the cone.  There is an alternative way of defining a parabola, which doesn't require us to do anything in 3-d.  Working strictly in the 2-dimensional Euclidean plane we can define a parabola as ``the set of points that are equidistant to a point and a line.''

Let's unpack that definition a little.  There are two ingredients, a line and a point.  The line is called the {\em directrix} and the point is called the {\em focus} of the parabola.  If the focus happens to lie on the directrix we get a degenerate case: the parabola turns into a line.  (This degenerate situation can also be seen in the conic section version of things -- when the plane passes through the tip of the cone.)  To say that a point is equidistant to two things just means that the distance between the point and thing one is the same as the distance between the point and thing two.  Distance between a couple of points is straightforward, but how do we measure the distance between a point and a line?  Short answer: measure perpendicular to the line.

Only one of the points in the figure satisfies the condition of ``being equidistant between the focus and directrix'' so that one would be on the parabola, and the other would not.  Of course, there are many other points which satisfy this ``equidistant'' condition, and when we fill them all in we get our parabola.

In the lab for this section we'll explore this a bit more.
