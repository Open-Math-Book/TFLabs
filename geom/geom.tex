\section{Introduction to GeoGebra}
\label{sec:geogebra}

GeoGebra is an open source tool that lets you do geometric constructions and also work with algebraic expressions (Hence the Geo and the Gebra in the name).

GeoGebra is available as a an app for your phone, or your computer, or you can just access it via a webpage: \url{https://www.geogebra.org/}.

For doing the labs in this chapter it will be easiest to just use the web interface.  If you want to be able to save your work and/or share your work with others (trust me, this is something you'll want to do) you need to sign in.  You can use an existing sign-on, like Google or Facebook, or you can create a free GeoGebra account.  

Once you are signed in, go to the ``Home'' area and click the ``Start Calculator'' button.

At the top of the page, in the center, there is a selection box that lets you switch between 5 different versions of the GeoGebra calculator.  When you first start the calculator it will be in ``Graphing'' mode.  At the left side of the header area you'll see a ``hamburger'' that lets you access the top-level menu for the app.

\section{Geometric Constructions}

In the classic book ``The Elements'' by Euclid, they layed out the ground rules for doing Geometry.  People have stuck with these basic rules ever since, because figuring out how to construct things with only a limited set of tools is a great intellectual challenge.  The tools are: an unmarked straightedge (not a ruler) and a compass.  When you first open the ``Geometry'' calculator in GeoGebra, only the basic tools are shown -- you can use them to create points, lines and circles.  These basic tools essentially mirror the straightedge and compass from Ancient Greece.  With just these tools you can do quite a lot, for instance, the following diagram illustrates finding the midpoint of a segment.

Notice that the construction above also shows how to construct a line that is perpendicular to a given one, and how to construct an equilateral triangle.

When GeoGebra was first released the set of Geometry tools was very limited, but over time they expanded the toolkit -- after all, once you've figured out how to construct a perpendicular bisector, why not just let you click a single button to get one.  Still, some of the tools that are now available stretch the rules of Euclidean geometry.  For instance there is a proof that it's impossible to construct a regular heptagon (that would be a 7-sided polygon with all edge lengths and all angles equal), but there's a tool in GeoGebra that will let you construct a regular polygon with any number of sides that you desire.

In the lab, we're asking you to explore the notion of constructability, but many of the constructions can be accomplished with a single click if you find the right thing to click on.  Please restrict yourself to only using the tools that are ``allowed'' for each exercise.

\section{Parabolas}

You may recall that parabolas are one of the conic sections we played with in lab 14.  As a conic section, a parabola is the intersection of a plane with a cone -- when the plane is parallel to the side of the cone.  There is an alternative way of defining a parabola, which doesn't require us to do anything in 3-d.  Working strictly in the 2-dimensional Euclidean plane we can define a parabola as ``the set of points that are equidistant to a point and a line.''

Let's unpack that definition a little.  There are two ingredients, a line and a point.  The line is called the {\em directrix} and the point is called the {\em focus} of the parabola.  If the focus happens to lie on the directrix we get a degenerate case: the parabola turns into a line.  (This degenerate situation can also be seen in the conic section version of things -- when the plane passes through the tip of the cone.)  To say that a point is equidistant to two things just means that the distance between the point and thing one is the same as the distance between the point and thing two.  Distance between a couple of points is straightforward, but how do we measure the distance between a point and a line?  Short answer: measure perpendicular to the line.

\centerline{\includegraphics{focus-directrix.png}}

Only one of the points in the figure satisfies the condition of ``being equidistant between the focus and directrix'' so that one would be on the parabola, and the other would not.  Of course, there are many other points which satisfy this ``equidistant'' condition, and when we fill them all in we get our parabola.

In the lab for this section we'll explore this a bit more.

\section{More with GeoGebra}

The GeoGebra project started as a tool for doing Geometric constructions.  Over the years, many other capabilities have been added to it.

The selection box at the top/center of the GeoGebra window allows you to choose between several modes: Graphing, 3D Calculator, Geometry, CAS (Computer Algebra System) and Probability.  So far, we've looked mainly at the Geometry mode, but today we'll explore some of the others.

There is a mathematical area that works well as an arena for looking at the Graphing, 3D Calculator and CAS modes.  It's known as ``systems of linear equations.''

The simplest possible ``system'' would have a single equation and there would be only 1 variable too.  For example,

\[ 2x = 8. \]

That's obviously a little too simple!  

Here's a system where there are two variables and two equations:

\begin{align*} x + y &= 14 \\ 
 x - y &= 6 
 \end{align*}
 

That's a little more complicated, but you can probably find the answer by a little bit of ``guess and check.''  We're looking for two numbers that add up to 14 and which differ by 6.

Several years ago when you were first learning about linear equations you would have encountered several ``forms'' for the equation of a line

\begin{itemize}
	\item[slope-intercept form] \rule{0pt}{24pt} \rule{12pt}{0pt} $y = mx + b$
	\item[point slope form] \rule{0pt}{24pt} \rule{12pt}{0pt} $y = m(x - h) + k$
	\item[standard form] \rule{0pt}{24pt} \rule{12pt}{0pt} $ax + by = c$
\end{itemize}

At the time you may have thought that standard form should really be the $y=mx+b$ thing, and that the actual standard form was rather poorly named.  It's at this point (while looking at systems of linear equations) that we see what makes standard form so useful.  One thing that's worth pointing out: in the other two forms, one of the variables is singled out (both of them are solved for $y$), standard form is more egalitarian, neither variable is prefered over the other.

\section{Projects}

\subsection{A pentagon}

There is a way to create any regular pentagon in GeoGebra.  The challenge of this project is to use the basic Greek geometry tools to construct a regular pentagon -- but do it in GeoGebra.

\subsection{Tilings}

Among the works of the famous Dutch artist M.C. Escher, there are \href{https://mcescher.com/gallery/symmetry/}{many} that illustrate tilings of the plane with recognizable figures.  Such tilings must of necessity involve some of the basic transformations that are found in the GeoGebra toolkit.

\begin{enumerate} 
	\item translations
	\item rotations
	\item reflections
	\item glide-reflections (a combination of translation and reflection)
\end{enumerate}

Use GeoGebra to create an Escher-like tesselation of the plane.  A good intro about how to make a tesselation is \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ggk6n-RX4OQ}.

\subsection{Quadric surfaces}

In 2-D we talked about the conic sections.  It turns out that these are also all the types of curves which are the graphs of quadratic relations in two variables.
Use the 3D Calculator in Geobegra to find all of the 3D quadratic surfaces (although, for unknown reasons, in this context, people say ``quadric'' rather than ``quadratic'').
Some judicious Googling might help.
