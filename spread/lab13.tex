In this spreadsheet, the MIN function has been used to ``drop the lowest quiz.''  Is this how you accomplished this in Lab 11?  The cells that contain weights for the various kinds of assessments are also there, and accessed in the formulas for cells using absolute (a.k.a. sticky) references.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Look up the {\tt CHOOSE()} and the {\tt INT()} functions in the function wizard, and figure out how to use them to assign letter grades with $+$ and $-$ modifiers.

\vspace{1in}

\item There are quite a few ``mathematical'' functions available in the function wizard.  For example, many of the functions that start with `A' are inverse trigonometric functions\dots  Figure out how to use ordinary division and the {\tt FLOOR()} function to find the quotient and reaminder you get when dividing one number by another.

\vspace{1in} 

\item Closely related to questions about the division process, there are two important mathematical functions called {\tt GCD()} and {\tt LCM() }.  Play around with these to discover what they do.  Can you determine a formula for {\tt GCD() $\times$ LCM() }?
